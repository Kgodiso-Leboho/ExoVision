# ExoVision — AI-Powered Exoplanet Identification App

*Exploring distant worlds through data, AI, and curiosity.*



## Overview

ExoVision is an AI-driven web application that uses machine learning to detect potential exoplanets in astronomical datasets and evaluate their habitability.  
It analyzes data such as light curves, distance from the host star, and surface temperature to determine whether an exoplanet might support life.

Built with React for the frontend and Python for the backend, ExoVision bridges artificial intelligence and astrophysics to make the search for new worlds faster, smarter, and more accessible.



## Key Features

- Automated exoplanet detection using AI and machine learning models.  
- Habitability analysis based on distance, temperature, and environmental factors.  
- Interactive data visualizations showing predictions and light curve patterns.  
- Dataset upload and scanning for CSV or telescope-based data.  
- Responsive web interface developed with React for seamless user interaction.



## How It Works

1. **Data Upload** – Users upload astronomical datasets or use provided samples.  
2. **Preprocessing** – The application cleans and normalizes data.  
3. **Prediction** – Machine learning models (CNN or LSTM) classify possible exoplanets.  
4. **Visualization** – The results are displayed with graphs and metrics.  
5. **Habitability Assessment** – The app estimates whether detected planets could support life.
